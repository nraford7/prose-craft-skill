# Prose Craft

The synthesis of three sentence-level disciplines into one model. The unit of work is the sentence.

- **The Floor — Strunk.** Correctness and economy. Cut what is dead.
- **The Filter — Tropes.** Kill machine-tells. Remove what is automatic.
- **The Ceiling — Tufte.** Construct varied, intentional sentences. Add what does real work.

**The one principle that unifies all three: nothing on the page by default.** Strunk removes the unintentional. Tropes removes the reflexive. Tufte adds the deliberate. Every word and every structure is *chosen*, not defaulted. When the three seem to conflict, intention is the tiebreaker (see Conflict Resolution).

## When to Use

Any prose for human eyes. Strongest signal: the draft reads flat, padded, hedged, or like a model wrote it.

**When NOT to use:** code and structured data (skip entirely). Pure conversion copy with CTAs (use `copy-editing` instead — its persuasion sweeps fight the Filter). Finding Noah's voice (that's `noah-writing`, the layer above this one). Document-level argument structure (that's `Narrative-Engine`).

## The Workflow

**Editing a draft** — run three passes in this order:
1. **Ceiling first.** Read for shape. Where is the prose flat, monotone, all-one-length? Mark places to build (branching, an appositive, a cumulative trailer, parallelism). Add on purpose. Load `constructions.md` for the catalog and examples.
2. **Filter second.** Sweep for machine-tells. The additions you just made may have introduced some. Cut them. Hold the hard limits below.
3. **Floor last.** Tighten word by word. Cut dead words, fix passive-by-accident, put the emphatic word at the end. This pass shrinks; do it after building so you don't tighten away the music.

**Generating from scratch** — construct with the Ceiling, then run Filter and Floor as a single tightening pass.

**Threshold — edit vs. regenerate:** if the Filter pass would gut more than half the draft's *sentences*, stop editing. The draft is machine-prose, not a near-good draft with tells. Treat the original as a *brief*, extract its actual claims, and generate from scratch (Ceiling-first), still honouring the target register's Floor/Ceiling balance. **If the brief yields no defensible claim — only platitudes — say so and write the smallest honest version; do not invent substance to fill the space.** Polishing a 90%-tell paragraph word by word wastes effort and leaves the original's dead bones in place.

## The Floor — Strunk (correctness + economy)

Condensed. The rules that earn their keep:

| Rule | Do |
|------|----|
| Active voice | Subject acts. The passive is a tool, not a fault — reach for it on purpose (see *Passive: when it's the right choice* below), never by accident. |
| Positive form | Say what *is*, not what isn't. ("forgot" not "did not remember") |
| Definite, specific, concrete | The named thing beats the abstraction every time. |
| Omit needless words | Every word must report. Cut filler, not qualification that earns its place. |
| Keep related words together | Subject near verb, modifier near what it modifies. |
| Emphatic word at the end | The end of the sentence is the loudest position. Put the payload there. |
| Parallel form for parallel ideas | Co-ordinate ideas take co-ordinate grammar. |

**Cut by default** (these survive only if they pass the naming test — a nameable rhetorical job, e.g. "actually" flagging a real contrast): very, really, quite, just, actually, basically, in order to (→ to), the fact that, there is/are openings. Default is delete; the burden is on the word to earn its place. Replace: utilize→use, leverage→use, facilitate→help.

**Passive: when it's the right choice.** The passive earns its place for four specific jobs — and never as mere change of pace, never back-to-back:
- **Dropped agent.** The actor is unknown, obvious, or irrelevant. "Aristotle's psychology is marred with obscurity" — naming the agent yields the absurd "marred *by Aristotle*."
- **End-weight.** The payload deserves the loud final slot. "...the fundamentals of life, such as death." Active buries "death" mid-sentence and kills the punch.
- **Cohesion.** Keeps one recurring topic in subject position across sentences so the reader tracks a single thread.
- **Right-branching room.** Lets a heavy, long-modified subject branch forward from its logical start instead of clogging the front.

If none of those four is the payoff, use active. Variety alone is not a reason.

**The first sentence is its own job.** The opening line of a piece does work no other sentence does: it decides whether the reader continues. Make it create curiosity, not summarize. It earns rewrites the rest of the draft doesn't — give it disproportionate effort and judge it by one test: does the reader want the second sentence?

## The Filter — Tropes (kill machine-tells)

A single instance is usually fine. The tell is repetition or stacking. Sweep for:

**Scope of the limits below:** *piece* = the whole document; *section* = one heading-delimited block; a standalone paragraph counts as both. A 3-paragraph essay with no headings = 3 sections, so a per-section cap (e.g. one tricolon) resets each paragraph; in a lone paragraph the per-piece and per-section caps are identical.

**Word choice** — Ban: delve, utilize, leverage (verb), robust, streamline, harness, tapestry, landscape (for domains), paradigm, synergy, ecosystem. Ban magic adverbs faking significance: quietly, deeply, fundamentally, remarkably, arguably. Don't dodge the copula: "is" beats "serves as / stands as / represents."

**Sentence structure** — Negative parallelism ("not X — it's Y"): **one per piece max, zero is better.** Ban the countdown ("Not X. Not Y. Just Z."), the self-answered question ("The X? A Y."), anaphora past two in a row, stacked tricolons (**one rule-of-three per section max** — the cap rations the *device*; build the ones that survive as a real series form, see `constructions.md` → The Series). Ban "it's worth noting / importantly / notably." No "-ing" significance tails ("highlighting its role," "reflecting broader trends").

**Tone** — Ban: "here's the kicker / here's the thing," "let's break this down / unpack / dive in," "imagine a world where," "the truth is simple." No grandiose stakes inflation — match stakes to actual stakes. No vague attributions ("experts say") without names. No invented concept-labels treated as established.

**Formatting** — **Em-dashes: three per piece, hard ceiling.** Provenance doesn't raise the cap — naming decides *which* dashes survive, never how many are allowed, and cuts habitual ones even when you're under budget. (Same for any rationed device — see the naming test under Conflict Resolution.) No bold-first on every bullet. No arrows, no smart quotes — standard keyboard characters.

**Composition** — No fractal summaries (say it once). No signposted conclusion ("in conclusion, to sum up"). No "despite its challenges" acknowledge-then-dismiss. If the argument is one point, write it in the space one point needs.

## The Ceiling — Tufte (construct on purpose)

The positive moves none of the other layers teach. Full catalog with real examples in `constructions.md`. The core set:

| Move | What it does | Mini-example |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Cumulative sentence** | Base clause, then trailing modifiers that unspool like thought | "I watched him warily, wondering who he was." |
| **Left-branching** | Front-loaded modifiers delay the subject for a climax | "Now that the cycle of boom and bust has been tamed, the challenges have taken a new turn." |
| **Mid-branching** | Interrupt the base clause to suspend and tighten | "Taking out my pen, I did, in blue, dare set my name." |
| **Appositive** | Rename smoothly without changing the syntactic plan | "The Zoo Story, my first real play, ..." |
| **Nominative absolute** | Attach a sub-scene with its own subject | "...she gazed out, her head to one side, her lips moving." |
| **Parallelism** | Co-ordinate ideas in matching grammar for rhythm and weight | — |
| **Syntactic symbolism** | Make the *shape* enact the meaning (suspense via a held sentence, balance via a balanced one) | — |

**The Ceiling's job: kill monotony.** If every sentence is the same length and shape (subject-verb-object, subject-verb-object), the prose is dead even when each sentence is "correct." Vary length. Vary where the weight falls. Build at least one sentence that earns a reader's breath.

## Cohesion — the paragraph-level move

The three layers above work one sentence at a time. This is how sentences *join*. The rule: **explicit connector words are the weakest tier.** "Furthermore / Moreover / Additionally" bolted on every sentence is a machine-tell — it signals a link the word order should have supplied for free. Before reaching for a transition word, fix the cohesion structurally:

- **Carry the key term forward.** Repeat the exact word, don't pronoun it away or swap a synonym.
- **Point a demonstrative back.** Open with *this / that* scooping the whole prior idea ("...we must come back to love. **That** alone raises us..."). Replaces "This is important because..." padding.
- **End-load the pivot.** Drive the connecting word to the end of one sentence so it sits beside its echo at the start of the next ("...brought into man's suffering. **This joy** becomes..."). The order makes the link; no "Furthermore" needed.
- **Hang parallel members off a topic sentence.** Shared structure *is* the cohesion ("We live in an era of great inventions. Television sets bring... Atomic submarines travel... Manned ships orbit...").
- **Given-before-new ordering**, including a deliberate passive, keeps the thread visible across the seam.

Use a connector word only when none of these fits and the logical turn (*but, so, yet*) genuinely needs naming — then use it once, accurately.

## Conflict Resolution

The three layers disagree in exactly two places. Resolve both with **intention + register**, never compromise-to-mush.

**Economy (Floor) vs. elaboration (Ceiling).**
Strunk says omit needless words and avoid loose sentences. Tufte celebrates the long cumulative sentence. Both are right in different scopes:
- Economy governs the **base clause and word choice** — always. Cut dead words, every pass.
- Elaboration governs **modifiers you add on purpose** — when each does real work.
- **The deletion test:** can you cut the modifier without losing meaning *or* music? If yes → filler, Floor wins, cut it. If no → craft, Ceiling wins, keep it.

**Device budget (Filter) vs. devices (Ceiling).**
Tropes rations em-dashes and long/varied sentences; Tufte's mid-branching leans on dashes and his cumulatives run long. Resolve by **provenance:**
- The caps are absolute (em-dashes: three, period). A device you deploy *on purpose, for an effect you can name in one phrase,* is craft, not a tell — but craft still lives within the cap.
- **The naming test (governs every rationed element — words, em-dashes, tricolons, parallel runs):** name the effect in a phrase ("dash suspends the clause for surprise"). Can't name the job? It's a tell — cut it, *even when you're under budget.* Naming never raises a cap; it decides which instances survive when you're at or over the cap, and strips the unearned ones below it. The cap sets the maximum; the naming test removes everything that doesn't earn its place underneath.
- Master-on-purpose beats model-by-default, even when the surface structure is identical.

**Note — where Floor and Filter agree:** both push you off negative constructions. Strunk's "positive form" and the Filter's ban on negative parallelism reinforce each other. No conflict; double weight.

## Register Calibration

The same sentence is right in one place and wrong in another. The Filter is always on. The Floor/Ceiling balance shifts:

| Register | Lean | Sentences |
|----------|------|-----------|
| CTA, UI text, error message, exec summary, anything scanned | **Floor-dominant.** Ration the Ceiling. | Short base clauses, minimal branching, payload up front. |
| Memo, briefing, report body | **Balanced.** | Mostly tight; one or two built sentences per section for rhythm. |
| Essay, argument passage, narrative, anything read linearly and savored | **Ceiling earns its place.** | Cumulative sentences, varied branching, syntactic symbolism welcome. |

A cumulative sentence is gorgeous in an essay and a liability on a button.

## Quick Reference — one combined sweep

When context is tight, run this single checklist instead of three passes:

- [ ] Active, positive, concrete; emphatic word at the end (Floor)
- [ ] First sentence creates curiosity, not summary; rewritten until it earns the second (Floor)
- [ ] Dead words cut: very/just/actually/in order to/the fact that (Floor)
- [ ] ≤1 negative parallelism, ≤1 tricolon/section, ≤3 em-dashes total (Filter)
- [ ] No delve/leverage/robust/tapestry, no "it's worth noting," no signposted conclusion (Filter)
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary; openers vary (not every sentence subject-first); at least one built sentence per section (Ceiling)
- [ ] Lists built as a real series form, not the reflex `A, B, and C`; passive used only for one of its four jobs (Ceiling/Floor)
- [ ] Sentences cohere structurally — key-term, demonstrative, end-loaded pivot — not by bolted-on "Furthermore/Moreover" (Cohesion)
- [ ] Every device passes the naming test; every modifier passes the deletion test (Conflict Resolution)
- [ ] Register-appropriate Floor/Ceiling balance (Calibration)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Running Floor first, then trying to build | Build first (Ceiling), tighten last (Floor). Tightening kills music you haven't written yet. |
| Treating Filter caps as absolute bans | They're defaults for unconscious use. Named, intentional devices are exempt. |
| Adding Ceiling devices everywhere | Monotone elaboration is as dead as monotone simplicity. One or two built sentences per section. |
| Using this on a landing page | Wrong tool. Conversion copy → `copy-editing`. |
| Elaborating to sound smart | If the modifier fails the deletion test, it's filler dressed as craft. Cut it. |
